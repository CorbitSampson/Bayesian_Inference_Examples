# Bayesian_Inference_Examples

## description

This repository contains some examples of Bayesian Inference techniques implemented in Python.

Currently there is a single Jupyter notebook that contains two examples, the details are discussed in this notebook. 
In the future I hope to add additional examples of varying complexity.

## purpose

The purpose of this repository is three-fold. 

First, the code within this repository can act as code samples for my work outside of my primary area of researach. 

Second, it provides a reason for me to prepare relativly clean code on example problems that I create as part devloping a strong baseline 
in fields outside of the primary field of research that I have worked in during my time in graduate school. Particularly, I am working on
Bayesian Statistics and Statistical Learning.

Third, I have often found it helpful to prepare or see very simple implementations of ideas that are often presented as rather complex. 
Specifically, applying ideas to simple toy problems, which allow you to examine every aspect of the process, and that do not include much or any additional and unnessecary information.
That is to say a "minimal" example. I hope that if anyone finds this repository they can be use the included examples to help learn new ideas, and that these "minimal" examples are as useful to them as they have been to me.
